\section{Dataset}

The dataset used in this project is the PlantVillage dataset, which contains labeled images of various plant diseases. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

\section{Preprocessing}

Preprocessing steps include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Resizing images to a standard size.
    \item Normalizing pixel values.
    \item Applying data augmentation techniques like random flipping and rotation to increase the diversity of the training data.
\end{itemize}

\section{Model Architecture}

The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) built using TensorFlow and Keras. It consists of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction.
    \item MaxPooling layers for downsampling.
    \item Fully connected layers for classification.
\end{itemize}

\section{Training}

The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset with the following settings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Image size: 256x256 pixels
    \item Batch size: 32
    \item Epochs: 50
    \item Optimizer: Adam
    \item Loss function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation}

The model's performance is evaluated using the validation and test sets. Key metrics include accuracy and loss, visualized through training and validation curves.

\section{Usage}

To use the model for predictions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Load the saved model.
    \item Preprocess the input image.
    \item Use the model to predict the class of the image.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results}

The model achieves significant accuracy in classifying plant diseases, demonstrating the effectiveness of data augmentation and model tuning. Visualizations of predictions and confidence levels are provided.
